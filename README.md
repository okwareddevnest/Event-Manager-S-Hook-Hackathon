   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < db.sql
   ```

4. Configure database connection in `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   const db = mysql.createConnection({
       host: 'localhost',
       user: 'your_username',
       password: 'your_password',
       database: 'event_manager_db'
   });
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
